                <p>The House of Creed has a notable history that is traceable for over 250 years. With seven generations that have shaped the fragrance house, the history of the brand is more than just tales passed from one’s grandfather, they are a matter of public record.<br><br><br>
                    In order to delve into the legacy of the Creed name, The House of Creed looked to a professional archivist who notably has worked uncovering the hidden archive of the family. Upon her discoveries, we found that the Creed family did not always start out in the fragrance business. Further unearthing uncovered a history of makers to tailors to today’s master perfumers, enforcing the historical fact that the Creed family are indeed a master of all trades.</p>
